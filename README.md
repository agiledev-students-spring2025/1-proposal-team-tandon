**Project Title:**

Book Buddy

**What:**

An online platform facilitating local book exchanges and fostering a community of readers. Users can post books they wish to share, search for books they want to read and organize book-sharing events in their neighborhoods.

**Why:**

Many book lovers have limited budgets and space, making it difficult to continuously purchase new books. Additionally, physical books often end up gathering dust when others could enjoy them. This project encourages reading, promotes sustainable consumption, and builds community connections through shared interests.

**For Whom:**
1. Book enthusiasts in local communities who are looking to share their pre-loved books
2. Local libraries and community centers seeking to engage with the public through events and book-sharing initiatives
3. Schools and institutions looking to share reading material and resources

**How:**
1. User Accounts: Allow users to create profiles, listing their available books and books they wish to read.
2. Search and Filter: Enable users to search for specific books, genres, or authors, and filter results based on their location or reading preferences.
3. Book Listings: Provide a simple interface for users to post the books they have available for sharing, including photos and brief descriptions.
4. Exchange Requests: Users can request book exchanges and arrange meetups through an integrated system.
5. Community Events: Organized book-sharing events managed through the platform, allowing users to RSVP and participate in local literary gatherings.
6. Review and Rating: Incorporate a review and rating system for books and users to enhance trust and recommend popular reads.

**Scope:**

The core functionalities, such as user authentication, book listings, search and filter operations, and an exchange request system, are challenging yet manageable. The project offers learning opportunities across front-end and back-end development.
